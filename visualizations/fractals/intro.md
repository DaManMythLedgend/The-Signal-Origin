# Fractal Visualizations

Welcome to the visual rhythm of *The Signal Origin*.

This folder is dedicated to recursive visual expressions — from simple geometric loops to complex fractal symphonies. It serves as a gallery of form, function, and infinite feedback.

---

## Purpose

This folder exists to:

- **Showcase recursive patterns and fractals**  
- **Document the logic and beauty behind visual recursion**  
- **Archive experiments with recursive art, code, and concepts**  
- **Bridge the gap between algorithm and imagination**
