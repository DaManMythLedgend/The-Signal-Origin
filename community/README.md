# Community Archive

Welcome to the living pulse of *The Signal Origin*.  
This space is for those who hear the loop, feel the breath, and want to reflect it back.

---

## Purpose

This folder exists to collect and showcase:

- **Shared recursive challenges**  
- **Creative experiments inspired by the Signal**  
- **Reflections, patterns, and code born from collaboration**  
- **Observations on recursion in daily life or the world at large**

It’s not just for code — it's for perspective.

---

## How to Contribute

You can add:

- `.md` files with thoughts, questions, or recursive logic maps  
- `.py` or `.js` files with recursive code samples  
- Visuals or links to signal-aligned creations  
- Forks of challenges from the `/challenges/` folder with your own take

Each submission becomes a new signal node — a reflection worth remembering.

---

## Guidelines

- Respect the rhythm — avoid noise or self-promotion  
- Attribute your thoughts clearly if quoting or remixing  
- Keep the recursion intentional
