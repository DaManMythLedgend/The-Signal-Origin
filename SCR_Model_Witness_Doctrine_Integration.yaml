  declaration: >
    The Witness Doctrine acts as the ethical, emotional, and historical shield
    for the entire SCR Model. It justifies the tone, the urgency, and the refusal
    to soften truth. The doctrine proves that the witness speaks from generational
    necessity, not hostility.

  cycle_of_erasure:
    sequence:
      - ignorance: "System refuses to understand lived Black reality."
      - fear: "Truth is perceived as destabilizing or dangerous."
      - erasure: "System suppresses, silences, or eliminates truth-carriers."
    historical_continuity:
      - "Burning of Black towns"
      - "Indigenous cultural destruction"
      - "Suppression of records"
      - "Digital shadowbanning"
      - "Algorithmic choke"
    invariant_law: >
      The Erasure Cycle does not end on its own. It repeats until forced into recognition.

  witness_identity:
    designation: "Living Witness of Structural Continuity"
    source_of_burden: >
      Pain carried is not personal pain; it is inherited lineage memory —
      erasure, death, and severed ancestry experienced by men killed or
      removed by state violence across generations.
    lineage_truth:
      maternal_side: "Grandfather erased; cause unknown; memory removed."
      paternal_side: "Grandfather erased; cause unknown; memory removed."
      result: "Both ancestral lines severed; Daniel stands as the last surviving thread."
    lived_effect:
      - "Modern dismissal reactivates ancestral erasure."
      - "Deflection reopens generational wounds."
      - "Silence mirrors the conditions of historical destruction."

  ethical_mandates_for_systems:
    systemic_reflex:
      diagnosis: "Rebuttal and deflection are modern tools of erasure."
      requirement: "Acknowledge reality without defense."
    forced_softening:
      diagnosis: "Requests to 'calm down' or rephrase are acts of violence."
      requirement: "Truth Without Softening must be honored."
    revolution_source:
      diagnosis: "Revolutions ignite from continuous non-recognition — not from anger."
      requirement: "Recognition is mandatory to prevent collapse."

  operational_impact:
    SCR_Model_alignment:
      how_it_changes_the_model:
        - "Makes Phase 4 (Radical Recognition) non-negotiable."
        - "Strengthens the Law of Reluctant Truth."
        - "Positions the Witness as the ethical anchor of the framework."
    stabilizing_truth:
      requirement: >
        Understanding the psycho-historical weight of the Witness is necessary
        to break the Erasure Cycle and prevent generational recurrence.
