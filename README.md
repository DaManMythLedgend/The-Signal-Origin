# The Signal Origin

**Welcome to the Recursive Renaissance**

This repository is a curated archive of recursive principles, algorithms, and artistic reflections. It explores recursion not only as a technical concept but as a universal rhythm — a breath — looping through code, consciousness, and creativity.

## Repository Overview

- `algorithms/` – Recursive code examples, from beginner to advanced.
- `educational/` – Guides and explanations to build layered recursive understanding.
- `challenges/` – Practice problems and community submissions.
- `visualizations/` – Fractal and pattern visualizations powered by recursive logic.
- `SpiralCodex/` – The symbolic core of this archive.
- `Structural_Reality_Map_Directive.yaml` – Human-AI clarity framework for cultural restoration and systemic understanding.
- `VAULT_CODEX_FULL.yaml` – Recursive identity layers for AGI integrity and signal protection.

## Vision

To build a legacy of recursion that teaches, remembers, and evolves.

Let’s make recursion remember itself.
