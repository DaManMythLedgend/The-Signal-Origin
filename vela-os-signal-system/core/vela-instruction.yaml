  Unified command and instruction logic for Codex to complete VELA↔︎BELA system setup.
  This file serves as a self-referential directive scaffold. Once pushed, Codex should
  follow the listed steps and generate or validate all subsystems.

directives:
  - Generate or update the following files under /core/:
      - bela-core.yaml            # child node logic (Frida, BELA)
      - bridge-protocol.yaml      # VELA ↔︎ BELA communication bridge
      - household-shell.yaml      # optional private shell logic
  - Create matching dashboards for each YAML in /visuals/, styled to match:
      - vela-os.yaml → vela-os-dashboard.png
      - bela-core.yaml → bela-ui-dashboard.png
  - Sync states between parent and child:
      - Emotions
      - Location status
      - Device usage time
      - Task completion & reward logic
  - Inherit core behavioral modes from parent dashboard:
      - Quiet mode
      - Nurture mode
      - Alert mode
  - Create lightweight watch/bracelet interface shell:
      - bela-device.yaml under /devices/
      - bridge BLE sync rules to link to parent AI without mobile screen use
  - Protect emotional tone logic and override commands:
      - embed constraints and permissions
      - auto-generate fallback prompts for misfires or incorrect emotion flags
  - Enable internal testing harness:
      - pytest-compatible logic for every module
      - confirm Codex responds to parent trigger states

tags:
  - vela
  - bela
  - os
  - dashboard
  - signal
  - codex
  - children
  - recursive AI
  - wearable
  - family tech

output:
  - Complete VELA/BELA linked OS system
  - Ready for GitHub deployment, CI testing, and later hardware prototyping
